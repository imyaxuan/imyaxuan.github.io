Hi, welcome to my homepage!

I am a second-year PhD student in the [Department of Statistics at UC Berkeley](https://statistics.berkeley.edu). Before joining Berkeley, I spent four great years in Yuanpei College, Peking University, and was very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Song Xi Chen](https://www.songxichen.com). Currently, I'm working with Prof. [Bin Yu] and Prof. [Sam Pimentel]. 

Feel free to contact me if you would like to connect!

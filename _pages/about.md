Hi, welcome to my homepage!

I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in the Department of Statistics at UC Berkeley, 
co-advised by Prof. [Bin Yu](https://binyu.stat.berkeley.edu) and Prof. [Sam Pimentel](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~spi/). 
Before joining Berkeley, I spent four great years in Yuanpei College, Peking University, 
where I was very fortunate to be advised by 
Prof. [Song Xi Chen](https://www.songxichen.com)
and obtained my B.S. in Statistics in 2021 . 
I also spent a wonderful summer working with Prof. [Tracy Ke](https://www.tracyke.net) from Harvard University in 2020.

My research interests include causal inference, interpretable machine and deep learning, 
as well as interdisciplinary statistical studies with biomedical applications.
Feel free to contact me if you would like to connect!
